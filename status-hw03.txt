Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
Zach Walsh

2. What hostname did you deploy to for Task 2?
hw03.zachwal.sh

3. What's the URL of your git repo for Task 2?
https://github.com/zwalsh/elixir-practice

4. How much of the functionality did you complete?
All of it.

5. Did you successfully deploy? If not, what's broken?
Yes.

6. How comfortable do you feel with Elixir now?
More comfortable, although the pattern matching is still
a bit confusing. It's hard to get a feel for what's idiomatic 
and what the best design is.

7. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
I found the calc functionality to be challenging. I ended up
just converting to postfix and calculating it as postfix. This
seemed more natural than any prefix algorithm for evaluating the
expression.
